<h1>Shield Statuses!</h1>
# This is a fork!
This mod renders color overlays on player's shields to determine whether that shield is disabled or not.

### Information:
**Colors**

This mod allows you to customize and choose the shield's disabled and enabled color via the mod's config screen. You must have mod menu to access this.

**Config**

The interpolation option gives you the choice to set the shield to either display two static colors or to have the disabled color gradually transition to the enabled color. This way, you can estimate when the shield will be reactivated. 

**Compatibility & Improvements**

With this version of shield statuses, it ensures to not mess with the actual minecraft textures of the shield itself, but instead renders the colors as an overlay in game to ensure the mod doesn't override custom shield textues from different resource packs.

This version of shield statuses fixes a bug from the original mod, where the shield would incorrectly display as disabled (orange state) even after it had been re-enabled.
